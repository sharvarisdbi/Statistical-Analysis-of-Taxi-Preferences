# Statistical-Analysis-of-Taxi-Preferences

This analysis was done by me as a part of my college assignment in Sem1 and 2.

Sem 1
I intially prepared a google form which included few necessary questions and this form was filled by various people through which I analysed, which taxi service is preferred by the people.

Sem 2
I made a few modifications in the google form which was again filled by various people and then I applied Inferential Statistics using Python as language and Jupyter as a repository.
